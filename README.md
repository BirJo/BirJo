- 👋 Hi, I’m @BirJo
and I live in the EU. Currently.

- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity. I am involved in a lot of initiatives in the field, but not much of a contributor to github. I mainly play around here.
I am also interested in mathematics, AI, automotive engineering.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning
to manage money better - for this I am playing with different APIs and financial maths.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SI application in automotive security.

- 📫 How to reach me - via Github messages.
